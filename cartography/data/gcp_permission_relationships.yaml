# Map principals that can read objects from a GCPBucket. Specifically,
# create an (:GCPPrincipal)-[:CAN_READ]->(:GCPBucket) relationship
# for principals that have a policy attached with _any_ of the below
# permissions. Similar logic applies for the other entries in this file.
- target_label: GCPBucket
  permissions:
  - storage.objects.get
  relationship_name: CAN_READ

# Map principals that can write objects to a GCPBucket.
- target_label: GCPBucket
  permissions:
  - storage.objects.create
  - storage.objects.update
  relationship_name: CAN_WRITE

# Map principals that can delete objects from a GCPBucket.
- target_label: GCPBucket
  permissions:
  - storage.objects.delete
  relationship_name: CAN_DELETE
