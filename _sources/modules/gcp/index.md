# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Cartography supports ingesting Google Cloud Platform resources, including:

- **Cloud Resource Manager**: Organizations, Folders, Projects
- **Compute**: Instances, VPCs, Subnets, Firewalls, Forwarding Rules, Network Interfaces
- **Storage**: Buckets
- **DNS**: Zones, Record Sets
- **IAM**: Service Accounts, Roles, Policy Bindings
- **Bigtable**: Instances, Clusters, Tables, App Profiles, Backups
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Clusters
- **Vertex AI**: Models, Endpoints, Deployed Models, Workbench Instances, Training Pipelines, Feature Groups, Datasets
- **Cloud SQL**: Instances, Databases, Users, Backup Configurations
- **BigQuery**: Datasets, Tables, Routines, Connections
- **Secret Manager**: Secrets, Secret Versions
- **Cloud Run**: Services, Revisions, Jobs, Executions

## Cloud Asset Inventory behavior

Cartography uses the Cloud Asset Inventory API as a fallback for service
accounts and project-level custom roles when the IAM API is disabled on a
project. It also uses Cloud Asset Inventory to sync effective IAM policy
bindings, including policies inherited from organizations and folders.

Permission relationship syncs depend on policy bindings from the current run.
If Cloud Asset Inventory is unavailable or the Cartography identity lacks
`roles/cloudasset.viewer`, Cartography skips those relationships for the
affected project. Other resource syncs continue.

The fallback covers service accounts and project-level custom roles. Predefined
roles and organization-level custom roles are synced separately through the IAM
API.

## BigQuery permission grains

A permission relationship on a `GCPBigQueryTable` means an IAM binding placed
**directly on that table**. Grants held at the project, folder, organization or
dataset level are not expanded into one relationship per table: they land on the
`GCPBigQueryDataset` and reach the tables through `HAS_TABLE`. Nothing table-level
is consulted when evaluating them (no table ACL, no row or column level security,
no authorized view), so expanding them per table added no information while writing
millions of relationships on large projects.

Query effective access as the union of the two grains:

```cypher
MATCH (p:GCPPrincipal)-[:CAN_READ]->(t:GCPBigQueryTable)
RETURN p.email AS principal, t.id AS table, 'table binding' AS grain
UNION
MATCH (p:GCPPrincipal)-[:CAN_READ]->(:GCPBigQueryDataset)-[:HAS_TABLE]->(t:GCPBigQueryTable)
RETURN p.email AS principal, t.id AS table, 'dataset grant' AS grain
```

Each relationship carries its own `has_condition`, `condition_title` and
`condition_expression`, so a conditional binding on one table and an unconditional
grant on its dataset are both represented, each on its own grain.
